## Background

This is a project I completed as a student at [hackreactor](http://hackreactor.com). This project was worked on with a pair.

## Install

This project uses [node](http://nodejs.org) and [npm](https://npmjs.com).

```sh
1. $ npm install --global
2. $ npm start
3. Go to http://localhost:3000
```

## Usage

This project is to showcase the use of subclassing of the initial class dancer. Each type of subclass dancer will inherit methods form the superclass but also have distinct personalities.
